<-- Simply answer the question - What would you like dbachecks to do that it doesn't? -->   
   
## New Check
   
### What would you like to check?
   
### What should be configurable for the results of the check ?
    
<-- A value, a set of properties (like FULL, SIMPLE, BULKLOGGED) -->  
<-- Should there be any default values for the configs? -->   
    
### What should be able to be excluded from being tested ?
    
<-- Could be databases, Could be Availability Groups etc -->  
<-- This would not be instances -->
